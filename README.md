## CNF-converter
Created a program, CNFconverter.py, which would convert any propositional logic sentence into its equivalent CNF sentence.

## SAT-solver
Build a boolean satisfiability solver that takes a set of variables and connectives in CNF and returns either a satisfying assignment that would make the CNF sentence true or determines that no satisfying assignment is possible, using Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm.
